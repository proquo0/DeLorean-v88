Purpose
-------

A primary goal of [GDG Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developers-Group-GDG-Chicago/) is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). GDG Chicago prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means [jerky behavior](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_jerk) isn’t allowed.

This goal and policy is applied to any and all events ran by GDG Chicago, including Windy City DevFest 2019. All attendees are expected to comply in full to this policy.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in Google Developers Group to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. We also include ways for DevFest attendees to report any violations. Together we can make Windy City DevFest a fun harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
--------------------------------------
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

Expected Behavior
-----------------
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before a conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and, presentations.

Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
-------------------------------------
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, Windy City DevFest organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a warning, temporary ban, or permanent expulsion from the community/event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
